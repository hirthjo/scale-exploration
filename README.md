# scale-exploration

This is a wrapper project for the [exploration of scales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02576) algorithm. The implementation as well as other useful methods can be found in the [conexp-clj](https://github.com/tomhanika/conexp-clj) repository.

## Usage

Run the [standalone jar](https://github.com/hirthjo/scale-exploration/tree/master/target/uberjar/scale-exploration-1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar) and follow the algorithms instructions.

    $ java -jar scale-exploration-0.1.0-standalone.jar

The scale of the resulting scale-measure will be dumped into a file in burmeister format.
## Examples

Example data sets can be found in the [conexp-clj](https://github.com/tomhanika/conexp-clj/tree/dev/testing-data) repository.
